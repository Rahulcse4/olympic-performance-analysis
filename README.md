Olympics Performance Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of countries and athletes in the Olympic Games. The dataset covers performance metrics from various Olympic events over multiple editions of the Games. The aim of this analysis is to uncover trends, identify the best-performing countries and athletes, and provide insights into patterns such as the impact of training, location, and resources on Olympic success.

Dataset Information

The dataset includes the following key variables:

1. Country: The nation represented by the athlete.


2. Athlete Name: The name of the athlete who participated.


3. Event: The specific Olympic event in which the athlete competed.


4. Medal: The medal type won by the athlete (Gold, Silver, Bronze, None).


5. Year: The year in which the Olympic Games took place.


6. Venue: The location of the Games (e.g., Tokyo, Rio, London).


7. Gender: The gender of the athlete (Male or Female).


8. Age: The age of the athlete at the time of competition.


9. Sport: The specific sport discipline (e.g., Swimming, Athletics, Gymnastics).


10. Team: If applicable, the team or country affiliation.



Methodology

The analysis was conducted using the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning: Missing values and duplicate records were handled to ensure the dataset is consistent and reliable.


2. Descriptive Analysis: Basic statistics were calculated, such as the number of medals won by each country and the distribution of medals across sports.


3. Trend Analysis: We examined how Olympic performance has changed over time by analyzing medal counts by year and country.


4. Correlations: The relationship between factors like age, gender, and the likelihood of winning a medal was analyzed.


5. Visualization: Charts and graphs were created to visualize medal distribution, top-performing countries, and athletes across different years and sports.
